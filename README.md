# Raffle Codes Maker - Alpha
A Basic but useful Software to make Raffles, maintaining randomness and equity with all participants and preventing fraud, pairing every participant with an Id-card and a Unique Raffle Code, even if they take many Raffle Numbers, everyone of them has a Unique Raffle Code.

## How it works?
If you know a person plan to make a Raffle draw, or even you want to do it, this Software will help you do it.
Make the List of Raffle Numbers, start where you want and make the numbers quantity you want as well, the system will generate Raffle Unique Codes for every Raffle Number you have, also... if you export as Microsoft Excel, you can have the list of Raffle Numbers and the Unique Code that belongs to every one of them saved in a file, and you can print it if you want. This Raffle Number Unique Code must be printed on the Raffle Ticket you give to your participants. The idea is you register the Participant ID on the Excel file the app generates, pair the ID with the Raffle number they choose, this way, the Unique Code printed on their ticket must match with the Excel Unique Code that belong to that number on List, if the toss-up day the codes matches between each other, the Participant ID registered matches with the Participant ID Card Number that you have to request to the person on that moment, their picture matches with them and everything is ok, it means it is legal and if their number is the winner, that participant is authorized to receive the prize. 

#### This system has been thought to prevent possible fraud coming from any participant.
